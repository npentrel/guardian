## A Guardian that Tracks Pets using a Pi, Camera, and Servo

In the run up to the new Zelda release, I realized you can build a stationary guardian robot with a servo and a camera. Adding a bit of machine learning, you can then make the guardian detect objects or people or pets and follow them around by rotating its head. Luckily, I am not the first one to have the idea to build a guardian and there was already a brilliant guardian 3D model on Thingiverse with space for LEDs and a servo.

I've written up a [tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/Print-Paint-and-Program-a-Guardian-to-Track-Humans/) where I walk you through the steps to build your own functional guardian with a servo, a camera, some LEDs and the ML Model service and vision service. 

Hereâ€™s a video of the finished guardian detecting me:
